Minesweeper
===========
I used to play Minesweeper all the time as a kid and it was one of those first games that really got me into puzzle solving games. It's simple yet fun, and it's always exciting to race to see how quickly you can solve the puzzle.  
I built this game with a friend my freshman year of uni and it utilizes C++ and follows the MVC video game design model. Try it out! There's a few new features and a spin on the original retro game
